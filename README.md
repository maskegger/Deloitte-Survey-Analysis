# Deloitte-Survey-Analysis

Team HyperNet: Ruchi Bhatia, Yuanmo Zhu, Maxine Ma

## Project Overview

HyperNet is a home internet service provider that is exploring the option of offering internet speed upgrades to customers as the demand for faster internet continues to grow. As a team of data analysts at HyperNet, our goal is to analyze the Deloitte Media Consumption dataset and provide insights into why customers demand faster internet speeds and identify patterns in customer demand. Our analysis will inform strategic decision-making for the company and help it remain competitive in the home internet service provider market.

## File Structure

The following files are available in the project folder:

- `data`: Contains the original and the preprocessed dataset.
- `Deloitte Survey Analysis - Presentation`: Our presentation slides.
- `Deloitte Survey Analysis - Report`: Our report.
- `EDA.ipynb`: Contains data preparation and exploratory data analysis.
- `Model Training and Evaluation.ipynb`: Contains Supervised and Unsupervised learning techniques we implemented, model evaluation and our final recommendations.

## Project Process

### Exploratory Data Analysis
In the EDA.ipynb notebook, we explored the Deloitte Media Consumption dataset to gain an understanding of its structure and contents. We performed data cleaning, data preprocessing, and data visualization to uncover insights about the dataset.

### Model Development and Evaluation
In the Model Training and Evaluation.ipynb notebook, we addressed two problems: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. For supervised learning, we implemented K-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of 10 different machine learning models. Based on training and validation accuracy, we selected Logistic Regression for further analysis. For unsupervised learning, we used K-means and agglomerative clustering to segment the customer base into meaningful and robust clusters.

### Results and Recommendations
In our report and presentation slides, we presented our findings and recommendations based on our analysis of the Deloitte Media Consumption dataset. We found that Q22, which relates to categories of frequently used apps, and age were the most significant factors in determining customer behavior in this context. Additionally, our segmentation of the customer base can inform marketing and business strategies tailored to the preferences and demographics of each cluster, ultimately improving customer engagement and satisfaction.

## Conclusion

Our analysis of the Deloitte Media Consumption dataset provides valuable insights into customer demand for faster internet speeds and patterns in customer behavior. By utilizing the findings and recommendations presented in our report and presentation, HyperNet can make informed strategic decisions to remain competitive in the home internet service provider market.
